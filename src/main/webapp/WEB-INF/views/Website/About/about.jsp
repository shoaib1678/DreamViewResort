								<div class="txt2">
									<p style="text-align: justify;">Bordered on three sides by
										the Satpura forests' lush green landscape and the wide expanse
										of the Tawa Reservoir to the north, Madhai is a serene jungle
										town located just three to four hours southeast of Bhopal. It
										provides the tranquility of a jungle town as an escape from
										the mayhem of city life, attracting nature enthusiasts and
										seekers of peace as much as anyone else. This quaint town is
										not simply a point of arrivalâ€”it's an experience in which
										nature presents itself in all its unadulterated splendor. The
										rustling of leaves, the exotic birdsong, and the soft lapping
										of waves blend together in a backdrop that elicits serenity,
										introspection, and awe. Whether you are venturing into the
										dense forests, watching wildlife in their natural
										surroundings, or just relaxing amidst nature's beauty, Madhai
										welcomes you to shed the ordinary and connect with nature once
										again.</p>
									<p style="text-align: justify;">As the entry point to
										Satpura Tiger Reserve, Madhai is ideal for initiating
										unforgettable wildlife experiences and eco-tourism
										explorations.</p>
